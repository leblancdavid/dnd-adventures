	\subsection*{Background}
	Valboro is an island three days sailing off the Sword Coast from Neverwinter port. The people of Valboro are an inclusive and welcoming society of mostly half-elves. The Valborians are a peaceful society of skillful artisans, farmers, with a rich culture of knowledge, wisdom, and fair commerce. Valborians have managed to remain at peace for generations because they favor diplomacy and economic arrangements over any kind of conflict.
	
	The island of Valboro is divided into east and west by the Borian mountain range, with the Boro river running through. To the east, the Valborians enjoy a very fertile land full of resources, perfect for farming, logging and mining. The weather and temperature on the eastern side of the island is almost supernatural in its balance, almost as if the gods had designed it as a utopia. 
	
	Very little is known about the western side of the island. It is known as the Abruhan wastelands, It comprises mostly barren wastelands and swamps. The weather is constantly hostile and ever forming dark clouds prevent any sunlight from reaching this side of the island. Few Valborians or others ever venture into the western region since the local Abruhani elves tend to be xenophobic and generally hostile towards outsiders.
	
	Due to the limited contact between the two, the Valborians and the Abruhani have maintained somewhat peaceful relations for over a century. However, recent troubling rumors of the Abruhani incursions into the Valborian territory have begun to surface. Rumors include strange sightings of Abruhanis, kidnappings of Valborians, piracy interfering with commerce.

	\subsection*{Adventure Hook}
	Farzaren Sylris, son of Engelor Sylris, is a Valborian noble and trader overseeing a shipment of wine in the city of Neverwinter. The Sylris family own a successful vineyard producing Valborian native Boro wine, and are a wealthy and influential family in the Valborian government. Having successfully negotiated a trade deal with a local Neverwinter wine supplier, Farzaren can be found celebrating in a local tavern. Farzaren is a typical wealthy flamboyant noble who generously offers to pay for any client’s tab (adventurer’s interaction with Farzaren triggers the hook). The atmosphere in the tavern quickly turns from celebration to despair when Farzaren’s associate Alkath informs Farzaren with news from his home island of Valboro that his beloved younger sister Tamrina has gone missing for days. 
	
	\textbf{\textit{Escort Farzaren back to Valboro Island:}} Threatened by this latest revelation, Farzaren recruits the adventurers to escort him on his voyage back to his native island of Valboro, offering them 100gp, and possibly more upon arrival if they choose to investigate Tamrina’s disappearance. Farzaren has the means to pay up to 25gp upfront if the adventurers can convince him with a successful DC 15 persuasion check.
