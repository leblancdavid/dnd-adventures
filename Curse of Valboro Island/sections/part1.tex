\begin{multicols*}{2}
	
Upon agreeing to escort Farzaren to Valboro, the adventurers are expected to meet Farzaren at the docks to board a medium-sized sailship for the trip. The crew consists of Farzaren, the ship’s captain (Half-Orc Elf named Alkath), and four deckhands (Gibnor, Tobferd, Radlael, Occar). The ship’s cargo consist of gold (heavily guarded), fabrics, materials, various tools, equipment, food and water. The ship’s crew is not well trained in combat, therefore, in the face of any threat, they will prefer to negotiate a way out or hide. The adventurers will be expected to handle any security concerns encountered on the voyage there.\break

\subsubsection*{Role Playing Farzaren}
Farzaren is a flamboyant and generous wealthy noble. Since most of his wealth has been inherited from his family's business, he can come across as a spoiled brat, but is still generally friendly. Farzaren cowers away from fights, and knows very little about anything other than commerce, specifically his family's wine business.

Farzaren is aware of the issues that currently trouble his native island but is less willing to discuss them with the crew. Players can attempt an insight check to determine that he is being secretive about the details of this trip, his family, and his homeland.
\end{minipage}}


\subsection*{Pirate Ambush}

After two and a half days of sailing, the ship finally approaches the island of Valboro. The city lights of Aleytheas are visible over the horizon as the sun sets behind the island’s Borian mountain range. Once the sun sets over the horizon, the wind and sea suddenly calms down as strange fog slowly rolls in, bringing the ship’s movement to a stand still. Given the lack of momentum, the captain orders the deckhands to drop anchor and hold position for the night. As the crew drops anchor, raises the sails, and performs all necessary remaining tasks, dusk turns to night and the crew gathers in the galley for dinner.

The atmosphere on the ship is somewhat tense given the unusual circumstances. The sea is so calm, no usual creaking sound of the wooden ship can be heard. Farzaren nervously tries to convince the players that the situation is normal, but a successful insight check from a player reveals his trepidation about the situation. 

While the crew is having dinner and telling tales in the galley, an Abruhani ship creeps up to the ship and four \textbf{Abruhani pirates} sneak on board the ship (sneak ability check). Some players may choose to remain on deck to stand watch. Due to the darkness and calmness of the sea, a DC 20 perception check is required to see or hear the Abruhani ship approach. Characters with dark vision do not have any advantage because the Abruhani have darkness ability which obscures all light and vision. The Abruhani ship should appear only as a large shadow to those with dark vision. Any player that fails the passive perception check for the sneaking pirates is surprised, (they skip their first round).

The ship is about 20ft wide by 40ft long. A small ladder connects the deck to the galley below. The galley contains crates and barrels of goods being shipped, including dining tables so movement is more restricted. The captain is in his quarters sleeping and the crew, when confronted with the pirates, choose to run and find cover.

When three \textbf{pirates} have been defeated, the fourth pirate attempts to escape back onto the Abruhani ship. When the \textbf{pirates} die, they vanish into a dark gray smoke leaving no remains behind. The \textbf{Abruhani pirates} carry tiny vials of deadly poison they use on themselves, causing instant death, in the event they get captured. The players should not be able to get any information from the Abruhanis themselves.

In the unlikely event that the  \textbf{Abruhani pirates} defeat the players, Farzaren and one of the deckhands get abducted by the Abruhani and brought aboard their ship. The players get stabilized and healed by the remaining crew. When they wake, they realize what has transpired.

\subsubsection*{Developments}

At this point, assuming he hasn’t been captured, the players may want to question Farzaren about how much he knows about the situation. Farzaren knows and reveals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The general history between the Valborians and the Abruhani (review the background section) although he is unclear about many of the details.
	\item The escalating tensions between their peoples, a fact Farzaren chose not to disclose to not hinder trade or discourage players from embarking with him.
	\item The Abruhani are not interested in any of the cargo aboard the ship. 
	\item Farzaren theorizes they are after him and possibly appear to be linked to the recent kidnapping of his sister Tamrina.
\end{itemize}

Once the Abruhani ship departs, the fog slowly begins to recede, and a light breeze begins to rock the ship ever so slightly. Because of the events that have occurred, the captain decides it’s best to stay the night, and wait for morning to sail into port Aleytheas. The captain recommends players taking turns standing guard overnight to be safe. This should still count as a long rest as the remainder of the night is uneventful.

\subsection*{City of Aleythea}

The following morning the players are woken up by the sound of the captain barking out orders to the deckhands to raise the anchor and lower the sails. In daylight, most of the island of Valboro is now clearly visible, including the city of Aleytheas and the Borian mountain range. The weather is mostly clear, sunny with a few clouds. However, over the mountains and beyond appears dark, almost black, clouds which hang persistently over Abruhan. As the ship approaches the docks, more and more traffic of commercial and fishing boats sail by the ship.

As the ship docks, and the passengers disembark, Farzaren orders Alkath to take care of unloading the supplies. A carriage is waiting by the dock with a driver notifying Farzaren that his father Engelor is expecting him. Farzaren urges the players with come with him to meet his father to discuss the kidnapping of his sister and the latest developments given the recent event.

\end{figure*}

The city of Aleytheas is a very beautiful and wealthy commercial center for all Valborian commerce and trading. As the carriage rushes through the city, the players get a glimpse of the city and its inhabitants. The locals do not appear friendly, mistrustingly glaring at the players. Valborians are normally friendly but the recent events have left the people weary of strangers and outsiders.

The carriage quickly arrives at Sylris Manor as Farzaren rushes in to go meet his father. Sylris Manor should be described as a very wealthy home, with beautiful furniture, art, gardens and fountains. Engelor is found in the manor’s library anxiously smoking a pipe. Engelor greets Farzaren with a hug, relieved at his son’s wellbeing, and holding back tears, they discuss the disappearance of Tamrina.
