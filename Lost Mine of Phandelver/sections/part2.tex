\section{Part 2: Phandalin}
Players arrive in the town of Phandalin which is being threatened by a gang called the Redbrands, headed by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. Phandalin is where the players will gather information about the story and possibly get some side-quests.

\subsection*{\underline{Locations}}

\subsubsection*{\underline{Stonehill Inn}}
The Stonehill inn is the local inn for the town of Phandalin. It has six rooms available (Sildar takes one). The proprietor is Toblen Stonehill and is a good source of information about Phandalin, the Redbrands. The people in the inn have some interesting gossip and information to share:

	\item[Freda, a weaver] The Redbrands harass almost every business in town except for the miner's exchange, they seem to be scared of Halia.
