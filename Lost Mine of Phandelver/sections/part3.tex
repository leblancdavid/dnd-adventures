\section{Part 3: The Spider's Web}
At this point, the players are following up on leads they have learned from in Phandalin. The players should have the following quests available to them:

\begin{description}
	\item[Agatha's Lair] Sister Garaele wants the players to seek out the banshee Agatha north of the ruins of Conyberry and ask about Bowgentle's spell book.
	\item[Old Owl Well] Daran Edermath wants someone to investigate what is happening near the ruins of Old Owl Well.
	\item[Thundertree] Qelline Alderleaf suggested the players consult Reidoth the druid at the ruins of Thundertree to ask about the location of Cragmaw Castle or the Wave Echo cave.
	\item[Wyvern Tor] Harbin Wester wants players to chase away the orc encampment near Wyvern Tor.
	\item[Gundren Rockseeker] Sildar Hallwinter wants to continue the search for Gundren, Cragmaw Castle, and find the map of the Wave Echo cave.
\end{description}

\subsection{\underline{The Tribor Trail and Encounters}}
While traveling to various locations, encounters may happen. Players travel 24 miles per day. Roll a d20 once per day and once per night to determine if an encounter happens (17-20). Upon an encounter, roll a d12 to determine which of these encounters happen:

\begin{description}
	\item[day: 1-2 / night: 1-3] Stirges (1d8 + 2)
	\item[day: - / night: 4] Ghouls (1d4 + 1)
	\item[day: 3-4 / night: -] Ogre (1)
	\item[day: 5-6 / night: 5] Goblins (1d6 + 3)

	\item[day: 11 / night: 9-10] Wolves (1d4 + 2)
	\item[day: 12 / night: 11-12] Owlbear (1)
	
\end{description} 

\subsection{\underline{Agatha's Lair}}
Agatha's lair is located on a trail leading north from Conyberry. (\emph{For more content, Agatha's lair could be the "Woodland Manse" from the Dragon of Icespire Peak adventure}). Agatha will answer one questions the players have. 

If they ask about Bowgentle's Spellbook for Sister Garaele: Agatha traded it to a necromancer named Tsernoth in the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago but doesn't know what's happened to it since. That's all the information Sister Garaele needs. Agatha is able to answer any other question the players have but only one.

\emph{\underline{Reward}: 200 XP for persuading Agatha to answer their question.} 

\subsection{\underline{Old Owl Well}}
Hamun Kost is a necromancer studying the ruins at Old Owl Well. The ruins consist of an old abandoned and destroyed watchtower, with \textbf{12 zombies} inside. Kost is in his purple tent studying. If the players provoke or fight him or the zombies, Kost will defend himself but generally he is not wanting to fight.

\subsubsection*{\underline{4. Druid's Watch}}
Reidoth the druid can be found here. He is mainly interested in studying the area and restoring it from it's corruption. He is aware of the blights, ash zombies, and giant spiders, but is most concern about the green dragon named Venomfang whom has made a nest in the remains of the tower in \emph{area 7}. He recommends the player leave the area because it is so dangerous.

Reidoth knows the location of Cragmaw castle and will gladly direct the players to it. He also knows the location of the Wave Echo Cave, but will not reveal it unless the players unless they can chase away Venomfang. 

\emph{\underline{Quest: Chase away Venomfang}. Reidoth wants the players to chase away Venomfang from his nest by any means necessary. }

\emph{\underline{Quest: Investigate the Cultist}. Reidoth wants the players to investigate the group of "folks with black masks and cloaks" that have moved into town. }
